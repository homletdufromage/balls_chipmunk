# Chipmunk-lib balls
![Chipmunk program](screenshot.png)
This small program has been made with the libs [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), [SDL2_gfx](http://www.ferzkopp.net/wordpress/2016/01/02/sdl_gfx-sdl2_gfx/) and [Chipmunk](https://chipmunk-physics.net).

You're free to do whatever you want with it, as long as you you respect the EULA of these libraries.
I just made it to try some stuff with Chipmunk.
